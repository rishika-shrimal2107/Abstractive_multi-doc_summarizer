 ##  âž²Our Tagline 
 Unleash the Power of Multi-Document Summarization (MDSum)ðŸ’™

## âž²Overview

In today&#39;s information age, efficiently processing large volumes of text is crucial. The MDSum project empowers you to do just that! It&#39;s a state-of-the-art abstractive multi-document summarizer, designed to extract the essence of information spread across multiple documents.

Key Features:

- Abstractive Summarization:Â MDSum goes beyond simple sentence extraction. It uses deep learning techniques to understand the semantic relationships between documents, generating concise summaries that capture the core ideas without sacrificing fluency.

- Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) refers to the process of generating a concise summary that captures the key points from documents of different domains. These documents can be legal docs, scientific docs, drama/dialogue , news/mails, medical docs and general document .

## âž²Prerequisites

This is list of required packages and modules for the project to be installed :

- Python 3.12.3
- Flask
- VSCode
- requests

Install all required packages :
```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## âž²The Dataset

Diverse Training Datasets for Robust Summarization.The project leverages a rich collection of datasets to train the summarization model, ensuring its ability to handle various text types and domains effectively:
### CNN/DailyMail Dataset:
Provides a broad range of news articles, fostering diverse writing style and structure understanding.
### SAMSum Dataset
Enhances dialogue summarization capabilities through exposure to real-world conversation dynamics.
### Guychuk/medical_summarization Dataset:
Fine-tunes the model for medical text by exposing it to specialized terminology and document structures within the medical domain.
This diverse training regimen equips the model to generate high-quality summaries across a wider range of content types.

## âž²Features
- The user can enter any text of desired length and type in the text area to get it summarized.
- He/she can specify the length of the desired summary.
- After getting the summary, the user can copy the text to clipboard to use it somewhere else
